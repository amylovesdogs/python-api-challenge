# DU Data Analyis Bootcamp Unit 5 Homework: Python APIs 

## Part 1: WeatherPy

This script visualizes the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. The citipy Python library (https://pypi.org/project/citipy/) is used to generate a random list of cites. The OpenWeatherMap API (https://openweathermap.org/api) is used to collect current weather information for these cities.

The code then creates a scatter plot of lattitude verses each of the following:
* temperature 

* humidity 

* cloudiness 

* wind speed 

Next, the code then calculates the linear regression, pearson correlation coefficient and r-values for each of the above relationships in the southern and northern hemispheres. It then creates a series of scatter plots including the linear regression line, the model's formula, and prints the r values.

See the jupyter notebook for analysis of these relationships.
